The communication between pgAdmin and the PostgreSQL RDS instance will happen through the reverse proxy set up by Nginx. Here’s how the flow typically works:

	1.	User Accesses pgAdmin:
	•	Users navigate to http://pgadmin.yourdomain.com/pgadmin/ in their web browser.
	2.	Nginx Acts as a Reverse Proxy:
	•	Nginx, configured as a reverse proxy, forwards the request to the pgAdmin server running on localhost:5050.
	3.	pgAdmin Responds:
	•	pgAdmin responds to the user’s request, presenting the login page or the pgAdmin dashboard.
	4.	User Logs in:
	•	Users log in to pgAdmin using their credentials.
	5.	User Interacts with pgAdmin:
	•	After logging in, users can interact with pgAdmin to manage and query databases.
	6.	Database Operations:
	•	When users perform operations in pgAdmin that involve the PostgreSQL RDS instance (e.g., querying, modifying databases), pgAdmin sends requests to the PostgreSQL RDS instance.
	7.	Nginx Routes Requests to RDS:
	•	If you included the /rds/ location block in the Nginx configuration, Nginx will forward relevant requests to the specified RDS endpoint.
	8.	RDS Processes Requests:
	•	The PostgreSQL RDS instance processes the requests and performs the necessary database operations.

The reverse proxy setup allows users to access pgAdmin through a user-friendly URL, and it ensures that pgAdmin can communicate with the PostgreSQL RDS instance. Nginx acts as an intermediary, handling the routing of requests between the user, pgAdmin, and the RDS instance.

Ensure that the configurations are correct, and check logs for any errors or issues. If you encounter specific problems or have further questions, feel free to provide more details, and I’ll assist you accordingly.
